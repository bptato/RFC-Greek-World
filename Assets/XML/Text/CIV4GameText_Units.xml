		<English>[TAB]The Maccabees were a Jewish national liberation movement that fought for independence from Antiochus IV Epiphanes. The Maccabees founded the Hasmonean Dynasty of Israel. In 167 BC, after Antiochus forbade Jewish practice, a priest from Modiin, Mattathias the Hasmonean, sparked a revolt by refusing to worship Greek gods. After Mattathias?s death, his son Judah Maccabee led an army of Jews against the Seleucid Dynasty. The term Maccabees is used to describe the army of Judah Maccabee.[PARAGRAPH:1]The revolt included many individual battles. In many, the Maccabeean forces won victory for their use of guerrilla tactics. After the revolt, the Maccabees cleansed the temple, and declared Judah Maccabee a priest. A Syrian army was sent to destroy the revolt, but returned after the death of Antiochus.[PARAGRAPH:1]After the revolt, the Maccabees were unsure whether to continue fighting, seeing their military success in the revolt. Those who continued to fight were led by Judah Maccabee. Judah Maccabee died in 160 BC in battle. Judah was succeeded by his younger brother Jonathan, who was already a high priest. Jonathan made treaties with foreign nations, causing more disputes between those who wanted religious freedom over political power. In 142 BC, Jonathan died. He was succeeded by the last son of Mattathias, Simon. That same year, Demetrius, king of Syria, granted the Jews independence from Syria and Simon went on to found the Hasmonean dynasty.[PARAGRAPH:1]Every year, Jews celebrate Hannukah to celebrate and recognize Judah Maccabee?s victory over the Seleucids and related miracles.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Azadan class of nobility was first formed in Parthian times, and was carried over into the Sassanid state, where they were a force to be reckoned with. They accompanied the king in the wars and displayed great courage and discipline. They are clearly the forerunners and founders of the "Knights" of later Arab history. They jealously guarded their status as descendants of the ancient Aryan conquerors and rulers of the mass of originally non-Aryan peasantry. These azadan formed a numerous minor aristocracy of lower-ranking administrators, mostly living on their small estates and providing the cavalry backbone of Sassanid army. Most prestigious among them were the armoured "Aswaran" who normally decided the outcome of a battle. Despite their downfall in the 7th century AD, their legacy endured in Europe, the Caucasus, India and the Muslim world. It was the elite cavalry of Sassanid Persia, who were the forerunners of the later Arabian Faris, the English knights, the Caucasian horsemen, the Indian Suwar (derived from Persian Savar), and the Turkish Tarkhans.</English>

L'importance tactique des &#233;l&#233;phants repose beaucoup sur leur capacit&#233; &#224; attaquer l'infanterie comme la cavalerie, et &#224; inspirer la terreur. Bien que les arm&#233;es indiennes aient utilis&#233; l'&#233;l&#233;phant jusqu'au XXe si&#232;cle, son utilit&#233; dans la pratique de la guerre a pris fin avec l'invention de la poudre &#224; canon.</French>

Mit Hilfe von Kriegselefanten gelang es dem indischen K&#246;nig Chandragupta, die Truppen von Seleukos, dem Nachfolger Alexanders des Gro&#223;en, zu besiegen und das Maurya-Reich zu begr&#252;nden. Auch wenn die afrikanischen Kriegselefanten der Karthager nur wenig ausrichten konnten, so machten sie ihrem Ruf als gef&#252;rchtetes Kriegsger&#228;t alle Ehre, als Hannibal seine Truppen mitsamt den Dickh&#228;utern &#252;ber die Alpen f&#252;hrte, um im Jahre 218 vor Christus in Rom einzufallen. Die taktische Bedeutung der Kriegselefanten resultiert zum gro&#223;en Teil aus ihrer Eigenschaft, sowohl Fu&#223;soldaten als auch die Kavallerie anzugreifen und in Panik zu versetzen. Das indische Milit&#228;r setzte sie zwar noch bis zum 20.

Grazie a queste unit&#224;, Candra Gupta sconfisse il successore di Alessandro, Seleuco, e fond&#242; l'Impero Maurya. Anche se gli elefanti da guerra africani di Cartagine non furono determinanti, la loro presenza nell'esercito di Annibale durante la sua traversata delle Alpi verso il cuore di Roma, nel 218 a. C., afferm&#242; la loro reputazione di arma temibile. Apparentemente, l'importanza tattica dell'elefante si basa in gran parte sulla sua predisposizione a caricare sia i fanti che la cavalleria, nonch&#233; sul panico che &#232; in grado di suscitare.

The theory changed from a migration of advanced Aryans towards a primitive aboriginal population, to a migration of nomadic people into an advanced urban civilization, comparable to the Germanic migrations during the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, or the Kassite invasion of Babylonia.</English>

		<English>[TAB]In the ancient Egyptian religion, female priests were known as hemet-netjer, which meant "servants of the god". There was a hierarchy in the priesthood from the high priest (hem-netjer-tepi, "first servant of god") at the top to the wab priests at the bottom. The wab priests carried out the essential but fairly mundane tasks of taking care of the temple complex and performing whatever function they were called upon for, such as helping to prepare for festivals.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The only public roles that Greek women could perform were priestesses: either hiereiai, meaning "sacred women" or amphipolis, a term for lesser attendants. As a priestess, they gained social recognition and access to more luxuries than other Greek women that worked or typically stayed in the home. Women who voluntarily chose to become priestesses received an increase in social and legal status to the public, and after death, they received a public burial site. Greek priestesses had to be healthy and of a sound mind, the reasoning being that the ones serving the gods had to be as high-quality as their offerings.</English>
