		<English>[TAB]The Minoans were a pre-Hellenic Bronze Age civilization in Crete in the Aegean Sea, flourishing from approximately 2700 to 1450 BC when their culture was superseded by the Mycenaean culture. The Minoans were one of the civilizations that flourished in and around the Mediterranean during the Greek Bronze Age. These civilizations had much contact with each other, making it sometimes difficult to judge the extent to which the Minoans influenced or were influenced by their neighbors. Based on depictions in Minoan art, Minoan culture is often characterized as a matrilinear society centered on goddess worship.[PARAGRAPH:2]The term "Minoan" was coined by the British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans after the mythic "king" Minos, associated with the labyrinth (which was made by a man), which Evans identified as the site at Knossos. It is possible, though uncertain, that Minos was indeed a term used to identify a specific Minoan ruler. It could also have been used to describe the current ruler of the Minoan civilization. What the Minoans called themselves is unknown, although the Egyptian place name "Keftiu" and the Semitic "Kaftor" or "Caphtor" and "Kaptara" in the Mari archives, both evidently referring to Minoan Crete, are suggestive.[PARAGRAPH:2]Homer recorded a tradition that Crete had 90 cities. The site at Knossos was the most important one. Archeologists have found palaces in Phaistos and Malia as well. The island was probably divided into four political units, the north being governed from Knossos, the south from Phaistos, the central eastern part from Malia and the eastern tip from Kato Zakros. Smaller palaces have been found in other places.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Minoans were primarily a mercantile people engaged in overseas trade. Their culture, from ca 1700 BC onwards, shows a high degree of organization.[PARAGRAPH:2]One of the most notable contributions of Minoans to architecture is their unique column, which was wider at the top than the bottom. It is called an 'inverted' column because most Greek columns are wider at the bottom, creating an illusion of greater height. The columns were also made of wood as opposed to stone, and were generally painted red. They were mounted on a simple stone base and were topped with a pillow-like, round piece.[PARAGRAPH:2]Occasionally the eruption of a volcano near Thera is tied to the legend of Atlantis, with either Thera or Minoa as the fabled place.[PARAGRAPH:2]Recent geological studies of the volume of pummice deposited around the island of Santorini, suggest that the volcanic eruption of 1450 BC was far more catastrophic than previously thought. Some suggest the eruption was at least eight times as large as that of Kratatoa.[PARAGRAPH:2]This eruption coincides with the end of the Minoan civilization.</English>
