		<English>[TAB]An Oligarchy is a form of government where political power effectively rests with a small elite segment of society distinguished by royalty, wealth, family, military powers or occult spiritual hegemony. The word oligarchy is from the Greek words for "few" and "rule." Such states are often controlled by politically powerful families whose children were heavily conditioned and mentored to be heirs of the power of the oligarchy. This type of power by its very nature may not be exercised openly; the oligarchs preferring to remain "the power behind the throne", exerting control through economic means. Oligarchies have been tyrannical throughout history, being completely reliant on public servitude to exist. Although Aristotle pioneered the use of the term as a synonym for rule by the rich, for which the exact term is plutocracy, oligarchy is not always a rule by wealth, as oligarchs can simply be a privileged group.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Die Oligarchie (vom griech.: oligarchia "Herrschaft Weniger", zusammengesetzt aus oligoi "Wenige" und arche "Herrschaft") ist in der klassischen (antiken) Verfassungslehre die Entartung der Aristokratie. Zur Abgrenzung von dieser Bedeutung und in Besinnung auf den eigentlichen Wortsinn wird heute auch der an sich gleichbedeutende Begriff Oligokratie (krat\EDa = Macht, Herrschaft, Kraft, St\E4rke) verwendet. Die Oligarchie bei Platon (427-347 v. Chr.) ist die gesetzlose Herrschaft der Reichen, die nur an ihrem Eigennutz interessiert sind. Sie f\E4llt wie die Aristokratie unter die Herrschaft der Wenigen, wobei die Aristokratie als gesetzm\E4\DFige, am Gemeinwohl ausgerichtete Herrschaft gilt. Diese Idee wurde zun\E4chst von seinem Sch\FCler Aristoteles (384-324 v. Chr.), und sp\E4ter vom griechischen Historiker Polybios (um 200 v. Chr. - etwa 118 v. Chr.) weiterentwickelt. Grunds\E4tzlich bestand in der antiken Staatstheorie seit Platon die Idee, dass jede am Gemeinwohl orientierte Herrschaftsform (Monarchie (auch: Basileia), Aristokratie, Demokratie) ein entartetes, nur an den Interessen der Herrschenden orientiertes Gegenst\FCck hat (Tyrannis, Oligarchie, Ochlokratie). Aus der Erkenntnis heraus, dass diese sechs Grundformen der Verfassungen notwendigerweise instabil sind, hat vor allem Polybios die Idee des Verfassungskreislaufs entwickelt, die diese Herrschaftsformen zueinander in Beziehung setzt.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]L'oligarchia (dal greco "oligoi" (pochi e "arch\E8" (potere, comando) \E8 il sistema di governo di una minoranza, di un gruppo ristretto di persone ed \E8 anche detto Governo di Pochi. Nell'antica Grecia il termine oligarchia indicava principalmente il governo di una classe scelta in base al censo, invece che alla nascita, requisito essenziale del governo di matrice aristocratica. Nell'Atene del V secolo a.C. vi furono il governo oligarchico dei "Quattrocento" nel 411 a.C. ed il regime dei Trenta tiranni del 404 a.C. Nella tradizione del pensiero filosofico greco, sistematizzata da Aristotele (vedi principio aristotelico) l'oligarchia \E8 una forma di governo "cattiva", non perch\E9 antidemocratica, ma perch\E9 quei pochi esercitano il potere indebitamente, o in quanto non ne hanno il diritto o in quanto lo fanno violando le leggi o, infine, in quanto lo esercitano favorendo gli interessi particolaristici a scapito di quelli della comunit\E0. Se, invece, i pochi che esercitano un potere lo fanno in maniera legittima e in vista dell'interesse generale, allora il loro governo \E8 quello dei migliori, e cio\E8 un'aristocrazia. Secondo Aristotele l'oligarchia \E8 dunque la degenerazione dell'aristocrazia. Nella tradizione del pensiero occidentale si \E8 conservata a lungo, dall'antichit\E0 al Medioevo, il concetto che un governo di pochi non \E8 cattivo in s\E9 ma solo in quanto i pochi governino male. Nell'et\E0 moderna invece si \E8 progressivamente affermata la concezione democratica e, con essa, la tesi che un governo di pochi \E8, in quanto tale, un cattivo governo: un governo buono \E8 quello in cui \E8 la maggioranza (i pi\F9) che governa.</Italian>

		<English>[TAB]Historically, the major juristic schools of Islam traditionally accepted the institution of slavery. Muhammad and many of his companions bought, sold, freed, and captured slaves. In Islamic law the topic of slavery is covered at great length. The Qur'an and the hadith see slavery as an exceptional condition that can be entered into under certain limited circumstances. Only children of slaves or non-Muslim prisoners of war could become slaves, never a freeborn Muslim. They also consider manumission of a slave to be one of many meritorious deeds available for the expiation of sins. According to Sharia, slaves are considered human beings and possessed of some rights on the basis of their humanity.[PARAGRAPH:2]In practice, slaves played various social and economic roles from Emir to worker. Slaves were widely employed in irrigation, mining, pastoralism and the army. Even some rulers relied on military and administrative slaves to such a degree that they seized power. However, people do not always treat with slaves in accordance with Islamic law. In some cases, the situation has been so harsh as to have led to uprisings such as Zanj Rebellion. However, this was usually the exception rather than the norm, as the vast majority of labour in the medieval Islamic world consisted of free, paid labour. For a variety of reasons, internal growth of the slave population was not enough to fulfill the demand in Muslim society. This resulted in massive importation, which involved enormous suffering and loss of life from the capture and transportation of slaves from non-Muslim lands. In theory, slavery in Islamic law does not have a racial or color component, although this has not always been the case in practice.</English>

[PARAGRAPH:2]Es gibt unterschiedliche Gründe für die Ab- bzw. Auswanderung von Siedlern, meist spielen dabei jedoch folgende Faktoren eine Rolle: persönliches bzw. wirtschaftliches Elend, soziale, kulturelle, ethnische oder religiöse Verfolgung, politische Unterdrückung oder die politische Förderung fremder Siedlungen.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]&quot;Risistemazione&quot; sta a indicare il trasporto di un gruppo di persone in un nuovo insediamento e il popolamento di una nuova zona. Anche se le migrazioni hanno avuto luogo in tutta la storia e preistoria umana, la parola colonizzatore (o anche pioniere o colono) &#232; spesso utilizzata in relazione alla storia moderna. [PARAGRAPH:2]Le ragioni per l'emigrazione dei coloni sono diverse, ma spesso includono uno o più fattori come: forti problemi economici; persecuzione sociale, culturale, etnica o religiosa; oppressione politica, oppure politiche che incoraggiano l'insediamento all'estero.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[TAB]El &quot;reasentamiento&quot; consiste en el traslado de un grupo de personas a un nuevo enclave para poblar una nueva zona. Aunque la migraci&#243;n ha existido en toda la historia, e incluso en la prehistoria, el t&#233;rmino colono, en ocasiones sin&#243;nimo de pionero, se suele utilizar en contextos de la historia moderna o contempor&#225;nea. [PARAGRAPH:2]Los motivos de la migraci&#243;n colonial son variados, pero a menudo incluyen dos o m&#225;s factores, como penurias econ&#243;micas, persecuci&#243;n social, cultural, &#233;tnica o religiosa, opresi&#243;n pol&#237;tica o pol&#237;ticas potenciadoras de la emigraci&#243;n o la inmigraci&#243;n.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]Belligerent military occupation occurs when one nation's military occupies all or part of the territory of another nation or recognized belligerent. [PARAGRAPH:2]In most wars some territory of the losing side is placed under the authority of the hostile army. Most military occupations end with the cessation of hostilities. In some cases the occupied territory is returned and in others the land remains under the control of the occupying power but usually not as militarily occupied territory. The latter was the case of Germany after WWII, which ended up being split into two different nations.</English>
		<French>[TAB]L'occupation militaire désigne la présence d'une armée étrangère sur tout ou partie du territoire d'une autre nation ou d'un belligérant reconnu. [PARAGRAPH:2]Dans la plupart des guerres, certains territoires du pays vaincu sont placés sous l'autorité d'une armée ennemie. La plupart des occupations militaires se terminent avec la cessation des hostilités. Dans certains cas, le territoire occupé est rendu et dans d'autres, il reste sous le contrôle de la puissance occupante, mais plus en tant que territoire occupé militairement. La dernière occupation fut celle de l'Allemagne après la Seconde Guerre mondiale, qui se termina par sa division en deux pays distincts.</French>
		<German>[TAB]Eine kriegerische milit&#228;rische Besatzung tritt dann ein, wenn die militärischen Streitkräfte einer Nation das Territorium einer anderen Nation oder eines Kriegsgegners vollständig oder teilweise besetzen. [PARAGRAPH:2]In den meisten Kriegen wurde ein Teil des Territoriums der Verliererseite der Befehlsgewalt der feindlichen Militärs unterstellt. Dabei beendeten die milit&#228;rischen Besatzungen in der Regel gleichzeitig auch die Feindseligkeiten zwischen den Kriegsparteien. In manchen F&#228;llen wurde das Besatzungsgebiet später wieder zurückgegeben, in anderen verblieb es in der Hand der Besatzungsmacht, normalerweise aber nicht mehr als milit&#228;risch besetztes Territorium. Letzteres ereignete sich nach dem 2. Weltkrieg in Deutschland und endete damit, dass Deutschland bis zur Wiedervereinigung im Jahr 1990 in zwei verschiedene Staaten aufgeteilt war.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]L'occupazione militare si ha quando l'esercito di una nazione occupa tutto o parte del territorio di un'altra nazione o fazione ostile. [PARAGRAPH:2]In molte guerre parte del territorio della fazione perdente viene posto sotto l'autorit&#224; dell'esercito ostile. La maggior parte delle occupazioni militari terminano con la cessazione delle ostilit&#224;. In alcuni casi il territorio occupato viene restituito, mentre in altri rimane sotto il controllo della potenza occupante, anche se solitamente non come territorio occupato militarmente. Questo fu il caso della Germania dopo la Seconda Guerra Mondiale, che fin&#236; con l'essere divisa in due diverse nazioni.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[TAB]La ocupaci&#243;n militar se produce cuando un ej&#233;rcito beligerante de una naci&#243;n ocupa todo o parte del territorio de otra naci&#243;n. [PARAGRAPH:2]En muchas guerras, parte del territorio del bando derrotado es sometido a la autoridad del ej&#233;rcito hostil. La mayor parte de las ocupaciones militares finalizan con el cese de las hostilidades. En algunos casos, el territorio ocupado es devuelto, pero en otros la zona permanece bajo control de la potencia enemiga, aunque ya no como territorio ocupado militarmente. El último fue el caso de Alemania tras la II Guerra Mundial, que acab&#243; siendo divida entre dos naciones diferentes.</Spanish>
