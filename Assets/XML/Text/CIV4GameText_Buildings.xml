		<English>A baker is someone who primarily bakes and sells bread. Cakes and similar foods may also be produced, as the traditional boundaries between what is produced by a baker as opposed to a pastry chef have blurred in recent decades. The place where a baker works is called a bakehouse, bakeshop, or bakery. [PARAGRAPH:2]The first group of people to bake bread were ancient Egyptians, in 2600-2100 BC. It was believed that they learnt their skills from the Babylonians. In the royal bakery of Ramesses, bread and cakes were often made in shapes of animals and used for sacrifices. [PARAGRAPH:2]The Greek culture influenced the Romans a lot after the Egyptians. From there, Bakery was transformed and flourished. The Romans were lusty and festive, soon the art of Bakering were a highly respected profession during the fourth century (A.D). The "job" was so profitable that in the time of Christ there were about three hundred Bakers around Rome. [PARAGRAPH:2]From the Roman Empire, the art of Bakery spread throughout Europe and the rest of the world. During the Middle ages, it was common for each landlord to have a bakery, which was actually more of a public oven. Housewives would bring dough that they had prepared to the baker, who would use the oven to bake it into bread. As time went on, bakers began to bake their own goods, creating numerous tricks. For example, some bakers had trap doors that would allow a small boy to pinch off a bit of the dough to later sell off as his own. This practice eventually led in England to a regulation known as the Assize of Bread and Ale, which provided harsh punishments for bakers who were caught cheating. In response, bakers commonly threw in an extra loaf of bread; this tradition lives on in the modern "baker's dozen".</English>

		<English>A bloomery is a type of traditional furnace used for smelting iron from iron ore. The bloomery consists of a pit with refractory walls, with one or more pipes at the bottom to allow air to enter. Once charcoal and iron ore are made available and prepared for use, the bloomery is preheated, and the ore and charcoal are put in throught he top. The charcoal typically burns incompletely, producing hot carbon monoxide that strips oxygen atoms out of the iron ore. This process proceeds without melting the ore, which is important if the resulting iron is to be forged. When the process is performed correctly, the bloomery creates a porous mass of iron and slag, known as 'sponge iron,' which can then be consolidated by heating it until the slag melts, and then beating on it with a hammer until the molten slag flows out of the bloom. After repeating this process enough times, the bloom can be forged into strong, durable wrought iron.</English>

Caravanserais supported the flow of commerce, information, and people across the network of trade routes covering Asia, North Africa, and South-Eastern Europe. Most typically a caravanserai was a building with a square or rectangular walled exterior, with a single portal wide enough to permit large or heavily laden beasts such as camels to enter. The courtyard was almost always open to the sky, and the inside walls of the enclosure were outfitted with a number of identical stalls, bays, niches, or chambers to accommodate merchants and their servants, animals, and merchandise. Caravanserais provided water for human and animal consumption, washing, and ritual ablutions. Sometimes they even had elaborate baths. They also kept fodder for animals and had shops for travellers where they could acquire new supplies. In addition, there could be shops where merchants could dispose of some of their goods. </English>

Anche se gli elefanti da guerra africani di Cartagine non furono determinanti, la loro presenza nell'esercito di Annibale durante la sua traversata delle Alpi verso il cuore di Roma, nel 218 a. C., afferm&#242; la loro reputazione di arma temibile. Apparentemente, l'importanza tattica dell'elefante si basa in gran parte sulla sua predisposizione a caricare sia i fanti che la cavalleria, nonch&#233; sul panico che &#232; in grado di suscitare. Malgrado sia stato usato nelle truppe indiane fino al XX secolo, alla pari di molte armi tradizionali, la sua utilit&#224; in guerra &#232; cessata con la diffusione della polvere da sparo.</Italian>

Utilizando elefantes de guerra, Chandragupta derrot&#243; a Seleuco, sucesor de Alejandro, y fund&#243; el imperio mauryan. Aunque estos animales no sirvieron de mucho a Cartago, su presencia en el ej&#233;rcito de An&#237;bal durante el cruce de los Alpes y la invasi&#243;n de Roma en el a&#241;o 218 a. C. bast&#243; para cimentar su reputaci&#243;n como armas terribles. La importancia t&#225;ctica de los elefantes derivaba aparentemente de su disposici&#243;n a cargar tanto contra la infanter&#237;a como contra la caballer&#237;a, y del p&#225;nico que esto inspiraba. Aunque sirvieron en el ej&#233;rcito indio hasta el siglo XX, su utilidad real, al igual que ocurri&#243; con muchas otras armas tradicionales, termin&#243; con la difusi&#243;n generalizada de la p&#243;lvora.</Spanish>

		<English>In the centuries after 1200 BC, the Phoenicians were the major naval and trading power of the region. Phoenician trade was founded on the Tyrian purple dye, a violet-purple dye derived from the hypobranchial gland of the Murex sea-snail, once profusely available in coastal waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea but exploited to local extinction. James B. Pritchard's excavations at Sarepta in present-day Lebanon revealed crushed Murex shells and pottery containers stained with the dye that was being produced at the site. The Phoenicians established a second production center for the dye in Mogador, in present-day Morocco. Brilliant textiles were a part of Phoenician wealth, and Phoenician glass was another export ware.</English>

		<English>The urban areas of the Indus Valley civilization included public and private baths. Sewage was disposed through underground drains built with precisely laid bricks, and a sophisticated water management system with numerous reservoirs was established. In the drainage systems, drains from houses were connected to wider public drains. Many of the buildings at Mohenjo-daro had two or more stories. Water from the roof and upper storey bathrooms was carried through enclosed terracotta pipes or open chutes that emptied out onto the street drains.</English>

		<English>The ancient Olympic Games were originally a festival, or celebration, of and for Zeus; events such as a footrace, a javelin contest, and wrestling matches were added later. The Olympic Games were a series of athletic competitions among representatives of city-states and one of the Panhellenic Games of ancient Greece. They were held in honor of Zeus, and the Greeks gave them a mythological origin. The first Olympics is traditionally dated to 776 BC. They continued to be celebrated when Greece came under Roman rule, until the emperor Theodosius I suppressed them in AD 393 as part of the campaign to impose Christianity as the State religion of Rome. The games were held every four years, or olympiad, which became a unit of time in historical chronologies.</English>
