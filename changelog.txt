Version 2.0 beta
Additions:
Added historical leaderhead swapping
Added David leaderhead for Israel
Added Hiram leaderhead for Phoenicia
Added platybuilder
Added multiplayer support (only hotseat with 2 players was tested, you might run into OOSes in network games). It's still quite unstable, opening a save during autoplay results in a crash. To access multiplayer, press the Go Back button after the mod has loaded.
Added conditional spawns: Byzantium will only spawn if Rome's stability is under very solid and controls Constantinople. The Sassanids will only spawn if Persia is dead.

General changes:
Changed the Dido leaderhead
Moved Dido to Carthage
Significantly altered the stability system
Re-enabled random barbarians. Most historical, "regional" barbarians still spawn, albeit that's semi-random as well.
The Hittites now start with Beer Making
The Hittites no longer start with Iron Working
Increased amount of Hittite starting units
Reduced amount of Nubian starting units
Reduced amount of Babylonian starting units
Reduced amount of Assyrian starting units
The Babylonians now start with Mysticism
Nerfed Athens's modifiers
Increased Nubia's inflation modifier
Lowered Rome's inflation modififer
Worsened Egypt's research modifier
Removed plagues
New Spartan diplomusic
Colonies civic now reduces negative economic stability
All culture of a civilization is completely removed from the map in case of a collapse of a civilization. This might be changed in the future.
Hittite UP now applies to everyone and adds +3 attitude points instead of +8 (so that it isn't completely useless)
Adjusted Elamite settler values
Goody huts are now randomly generated
Changed third Egyptian UHV condition
Changed second Sumerian UHV condition
Byzantine UP now requires Christianity
Removed 1.8 religion mechanics except holy city relocations. I still like the idea, but it was badly implemented and I'd like to focus on other things for now instead of rewriting that as well.
Changed Minoan unique building to Anaktora, a replacement for walls which reduces city maintenance costs by 20%
And other things I've already forgotten about...

Map changes:
Changed lots of stuff in Egypt, including the Nile's flow
Removed peaks around Egypt
Added a tile to the Sinai peninsula to prevent building the Suez canal
Removed flood plains from the Nile delta and added a wheat resource in exchange
Changed some coast tiles to ocean and vice versa
Completely remade Nubia, now it looks somewhat less weird

Technical changes:
Almost all RFC mechanics were completely rewritten. These are:
- Dynamic rise of civilizations (in DLL). A notable advantage of the new implementation is that all playable civilizations are independent from player slots. This means that any number of civilizations can be added, so long as the number of alive players never exceed the maximum number of slots.
- Appropriate starting techs, starting units, starting wars and historical independent cities (stored in WBSave, handled by DLL)
- Stability and collapse of civilizations (in DLL)
- Pre-defined areas (stored in WBSave, handled by DLL). These are now called provinces and their names are displayed when hovering over a tile (green = core province, red = not core province).
- Modifiers (stored in WBSave, handled by DLL)
- Leader swapping (swap dates are stored in XML, handled by DLL)
- Historical settler values (stored in WBSave, handled by DLL)
- City names (stored in WBSave, handled by DLL)
- UPs (now all of them in DLL)
WBSaves are now stored in json format to make all of this easier to handle
Removed some modifier categories that didn't really make sense (and weren't properly implemented in previous versions anyways)
Removed many XML comments (they were triggering annoying asserts)
Reduced the amount of slots by 1 as a proof of concept. Reason being that if there are any bugs related to my new Rise and Fall implementation (which is quite likely), this should be the easiest way to discover them.
Civilization IDs are now hardcoded in CvEnums.h (as opposed to the previous version, where they were in CvRhyes.h and Consts.py).

Fixes:
Fixed quite a few problems related to the previous RFC implementation
Fixed some dynamic name TXT keys
Fixed some diplo messages
Fixed Byzantine UP
RFC music isn't played after starting the game
Fixed some leaders' favorite religion

Known issues:
Economic stability is terribly unbalanced
AI chooses stupid civic combinations regarding civic stability
900BC scenario is broken
AI settling patterns are weird since the compact empire modifier has been fixed

Version 1.8
Additions:
New art/names for religions
New art/names for great shrines temples and monasteries
New art/names for missionaries
Wonder movies for all shrines (except the Maabed, I couldn't find any for that)

Fixed 900BC autoplay (I forgot to test it before the previous release)
Other small bugfixes

Version 1.7
Additions:
Babylonian UHV
Hittite UHV
Experimental city plundering: the idea is that you should be able to sack cities without keeping them. Only available to the player. WIP, might remove it later
Bronze age collapse: civs randomly receive a -2 to 0 stability malus every turn from 1200BC to 1000BC

Changes:
Changed Patronage cost to low
Changed Temple Economy building modifier to 25%
Increased Sea People strength to 5
Increased amount of Sea People almost everywhere
Removed UHV checks from AI civs
Barbarian archers don't spawn anymore as they just pointlessly wandered around the map anyways
Civic stability overhaul: the stability system was still using old values for checking civic compatibility, now it checks for RFGW civics; still WIP
More severe stability penalties for losing cities
Changed Egypt's and Persia's starting civics
Persia starts with Fortification and Bread Making
Changed Numidian starting plot (desert hill) to plains hill so that they can settle their capital
Halved culture city defence modifiers
Reduced walls' city defence modifier to 30%

Technical changes:
Removed a lot of useless vanilla leaderheads from the XML
UHV strings moved to XML
Removed a bunch of constants from the DLL

Fixes:
Removed Great Depressions
Fixed starting expansion civics for some civs
Removed unit stacking limit (I still don't know if it was intentional, a bug, or both... it was certainly annoying and didn't work anyways)
Some starting units of the AI are immobilized at their spawn
Fixed 900BC starting cities and units
Fixed settler maps

Version 1.6
Additions:
Added Elam
	They are intended to boost Persia by building up infrastructure in their core and collapsing before their spawn. Still needs balancing for this to work well.

Changes:
Altered some core areas
Buffed:
	Rome:
		Their UU now has 2 movement and 15% city attack instead of 10%
		More starting units
	Persia:
		Larsa is now in their core
		More starting units
	This makes them expand somewhat better, although they still get trampled by their older neighbors way too often
Nerfed Hittite starting units
Nerfed Assyria's core
Changed the unit AI of some civs' starting units
Moved Hadrian's Wall to Military Science
Moved Temple of Artemis to Record Keeping

Technical changes:
Removed vanilla RFC constants
Removed most non-researchable techs and other XML garbage
Replaced building and tech constants with functions
Temporarly disabled mercenaries, as the game was still using the old civ groups to determine their location

Fixes:
Removed leader traits as they were quite random and broke a few things (eg no anarchy on some civic changes)
Players' first city can now be founded in enemy territory: Babylon and Sparta can found their capital
Fixed the Hittite core
Fixed Greek civs' languages
Fixed religion buttons
Possibly fixed late-game CtDs (not sure though)
Completing three UHVs trigger victory

Known issues:
The Hittites no longer collapse by 1000BC because they have a core now
Old civs can still become way too powerful
The mod attempts to spawn units with an extremely high id sometimes (probably doesn't affect anything but I will have to look into it)
Vanilla RFC unit stacking bug
Vanilla RFC "dumb AI moves out of starting city with their entire army" bug

removed Athens from the Athenian city name list. It gets built in odd places. Same for Rome for the Roman city lists
Rome can now produce units slightly faster

Made Bureaucracy available with its own tech: Record Keeping, which is also a prereq for Education, that requires mathematics and alphabet

give starting nations technologies for the appropriate starting religions.
Moved drama into the tech tree, make it researchable
Map
Replace Kashgar mountains with land for Bactria
Units:
Make Merchants a national unit (limited to three of them at a time). They are overpowered otherwise
Background Fixes:
Fixed the &#8220;tuple index out of range&#8221; error associated with the Indus Valley by adding another 0 to the end of tBirths in consts.py. Not sure why this helps, but for some reason it does. Not sure what the consequences would be. They still collapse, which is ok, I guess.
Fixed a tuple index out of range exception related to AI Wars

Units:
Made Pirates not go on Ocean
Gave triremes and Quinqueremes anti-pirate bonus
Make pirates also require trade.

Merchant unit added. Functions like the great merchant, but its trade mission produces much less gold. I&#8217;m not sure if the AI knows how to use them.
Raised the strength of hoplites to 5. If they are suppose to be a technological upgrade of spearmen, then they have to actually be better than spearmen
Terrain Features/Resources
Made jungles passable
Made Jungles chopable with Iron Working
Fixed bug for the paved road
Added olives and pearls and salt resources
Pearl Resources are near: Bahrain (replace a clam), Red Sea, South India, Persia, Algeria (replace a clam)

Fix Leaning tower TXT_KEY
Fix Flavian Amphitheatre TXT
Barbs and Independents:
Move Yemen City 3 South and 1 East
Give Saana starting archers
Added Libyan barbarian armies to weaken Egypt. Currently, 4 spawn on Monarch level, and this seems to be the optimal number, as Egypt sometimes survives, and is usually overwhelmed. I may want to decrease this later, as I still want Egypt to survive more often than it actually does
Adding Numidian Barbarians to pressure Carthage.
Civs:
Give Rome storytelling at start
The Nubian starting units are now Medjay instead of archers, and there are now 4 of them instead of 3. This should make Nubia harder to steamroll (before, an Egyptian player can take over them in a few turns)

Civilizations: Nubia no longer collapses
Adding Indus Valley Civilization
Better Etruscan LH
Map:
I have expanded the map to fill in the blank areas. This added Ethiopea, Scotland, India and ussless Saharan and Siberian land. The reasons for this is are 1: to give the IVC more room. 2: To give Nubia more room. 3: To make Brittan worth colonizing. 4: For a future Vandal civ or barbs.

Gave Hittites Animal Husbandry so it takes longer for barbs to overrun them (they are still overrun, as they historically should be, but they have time to become a threat to the South empires and a player can lead them easier (no chariots against warriors and swordsmen against chariots)
Britan is now one Island

Version 0.1 (Spaceman98):
City Name Map Working
Missionary renaming
All Python exceptions fixed
